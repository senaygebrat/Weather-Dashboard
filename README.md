<!-- 
1. Gather the value of the user's input when they click the "search" button
2. Using this value, you will pass it into the api call
3. Then you will need variables that grab HTML elements of where you want to display the data
4. Make the innerText of these HTML elements equal to the date, temp, etc 

-Well, you do grab the user input value on line 48 (59) of the screenshot that I sent
-From here you need to correctly implement the fetch call in the currentDay() function and get the response

Similarly to your getApi() function
-For the current day you can just create variables that select the HTML element.
-For the future days, you may want to dynamically create the elements (in regards to line 6!!!!)
